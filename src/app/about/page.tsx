          <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700 mb-4 sm:mb-6">
            We are a proud, family-owned and operated business, founded by a Santa Fe native who was born and raised in the heart of the Land of Enchantment. 
            Our deep roots in Santa Fe inspire everything we do â€” from our commitment to exceptional service to our dedication to supporting our local community. 
            With a genuine love for our home and its people, we strive to provide reliable, trustworthy, and personalized service that reflects the warmth and tradition of our city. 
            Enchantment Disposal began with a single truck and a mission to improve local sanitation. Today, we serve residential and commercial customers across northern NM, offering a range of dumpster sizes to meet every need.
